# NEXT_STEPS: Core Infrastructure Implementation Plan

## 1. Express Server (Already Implemented)

- **Status:** Complete

## 2. React Frontend

**Goal:** Establish a functional React frontend that communicates with the backend and provides a foundation for UI/UX.

**Steps:**

- Set up the React app structure in `/frontend`.
- Implement a basic App component and folder structure for components, assets, and styles.
- Integrate state management (e.g., useState, useContext, or Redux if needed).
- Implement API integration for backend communication (e.g., fetch or axios).
- Add error handling for API calls and UI feedback.
- Create a minimal UI/UX for initial user interaction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- App starts with `npm start` in `/frontend`.
- Can successfully call backend endpoints and display results.
- Handles errors gracefully and displays user-friendly messages.

## 3. Database Setup

**Goal:** Ensure reliable data persistence using SQLite.

**Steps:**

- Initialize SQLite database in `/data`.
- Design and document the schema for required tables.
- Implement a migration system or script for schema updates.
- Implement basic CRUD operations in the backend (create, read, update, delete).
- Add error handling for all database operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Database file exists and is accessible.
- All required tables are present and correctly structured.
- CRUD operations work as expected and handle errors.

**General Guidance:**

- For each task, start by reviewing what (if anything) is already implemented.
- Use the status assessment checklist from ISSUES.md to verify or plan each step.
- Document findings and next steps before moving to implementation.
- After implementation, test thoroughly and update documentation.
