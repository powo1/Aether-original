# Implementation Issue: Express Server Initialization Clarity

## Context

The initial NEXT_STEPS.md provides a solid outline for Express server setup, but to ensure clarity for all contributors (human or agentic), further detail is recommended.

## Enhancements for Clarity

### 1. File/Directory Structure Example

```
/workspaces/Aether-original/
├── backend/
│   └── index.js
├── docs/
│   └── NEXT_STEPS.md
│   └── ISSUES.md
...
```

### 2. Sample Code Snippet

```js
// backend/index.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ status: "ok" });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### 3. Command Examples

- Start the server:
  ```sh
  node backend/index.js
  ```
- Test the health endpoint:
  ```sh
  curl http://localhost:3000/health
  # or open in a browser
  ```

### 4. Testing Instructions

- The server should start without errors and log the port.
- Visiting `/health` should return `{ "status": "ok" }` with HTTP 200.
- Changing the `PORT` environment variable should change the listening port.

### 5. Additional Notes

- Use `.env.example` to document environment variables.
- This step is intentionally minimal; middleware, error handling, and advanced features are added in later steps.

## General Task Verification Template

For each implementation or checklist item, follow this process:

### 1. Status Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Feature/code already exists
- [ ] Feature meets all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Only documentation/verification needed
- [ ] Implementation or refactor required

### 2. Verification Steps

- Locate and review existing code or feature.
- Compare with acceptance criteria (from ROADMAP, MVP_CHECKLIST, or NEXT_STEPS).
- If complete, document findings and mark as done (include date and reviewer).
- If incomplete, proceed with implementation or refactor as needed.

### 3. Documentation of Findings

- If feature is already implemented:
  - Add a note: "Verified as complete on [date] by [name/agent]. No further action required."
- If gaps are found:
  - List what is missing or needs improvement.
  - Assign next steps accordingly.

## Verification: Express Server Initialization (2025-06-16)

- [x] File/Directory Structure Example
  - backend/index.js exists as required.
- [x] Sample Code Snippet
  - Express server is initialized in backend/index.js.
- [x] Command Examples
  - Server starts with `node backend/index.js`.
  - Health endpoint accessible at `/health`.
- [x] Testing Instructions
  - Server starts without errors and logs the port.
  - `/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }` with HTTP 200.
  - Changing `PORT` env variable changes the listening port.
- [x] Additional Notes
  - .env.example exists and documents environment variables.
  - Middleware, error handling, and advanced features are planned for later steps.

**Result:**
All Express Server Initialization requirements have been verified as complete on 2025-06-16. No further action required for this item.

---

**Recommendation:**
Incorporate these details into onboarding or task documentation to ensure all contributors can implement and verify the Express server setup with confidence.
