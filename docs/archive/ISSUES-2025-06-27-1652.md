# Implementation Issues & Task Breakdown: React Frontend

## Purpose

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the implementation tasks for the React Frontend, as outlined in the Core Infrastructure section of the MVP Checklist and NEXT_STEPS.

## React Frontend Implementation

### Goal

Establish a functional React frontend that communicates with the backend and provides a foundation for UI/UX.

### Tasks & Subtasks

1. **Project Structure & Setup**

   - [x] Ensure `/frontend` directory exists and is a valid React project (e.g., created with Create React App or Vite).
   - [x] Organize folders for components, assets, and styles.
   - [x] Add README or documentation for frontend setup.

2. **App Component & Routing**

   - [x] Implement a basic `App.js` (or `App.jsx`) as the root component.
   - [x] Set up routing if multiple pages are needed (e.g., React Router). _(N/A: single-page app for now)_

3. **State Management**

   - [x] Use React's `useState` and `useEffect` for local state.
   - [x] Plan for global state (e.g., Context API or Redux) if needed for future features. _(Not needed yet)_

4. **API Integration**

   - [x] Implement a utility for making API calls (e.g., using `fetch` or `axios`). _(Handled inline in components)_
   - [x] Create functions to call backend endpoints (e.g., `/prompt`, `/preview`, `/health`).
   - [x] Handle loading, success, and error states for API calls.

5. **Error Handling & Feedback**

   - [x] Display user-friendly error messages for failed API calls.
   - [x] Add loading indicators for async operations.
   - [x] Log errors for debugging.

6. **Basic UI/UX**

   - [x] Implement a minimal UI for user interaction (prompt input, preview, etc.).
   - [x] Apply basic styling for usability and clarity.
   - [x] Ensure accessibility best practices are followed. _(Basic, can be improved)_

7. **Testing & Verification**
   - [x] Confirm the app starts with `npm start` in `/frontend`.
   - [x] Verify backend communication works (e.g., prompt submission, preview display).
   - [x] Test error handling and UI feedback.

### Notes on Current State

- Project structure, local state management, API integration, error handling, and minimal UI/UX are implemented and functional.
- No routing or global state is needed at this stage.
- All backend endpoints respond as expected, including error cases.
- Accessibility and test coverage are minimal and can be improved in future iterations.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- App starts and runs without errors.
- User can submit prompts and see results from the backend.
- Errors are handled gracefully and displayed to the user.
- Code is organized and documented for future development.

## Notice

**Database Setup** will be the next area of focus after React Frontend implementation and verification.
