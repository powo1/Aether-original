# NEXT STEPS: Implementation Plan

## Task: Express Server Initialization

### Goal

Establish a foundational Express server to handle HTTP requests and serve as the backend for the AetherPress prototype.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Entry Point**

   - File: `backend/index.js`
   - Set up a basic Express app instance.
   - Configure the app to listen on a configurable port (default: 3000).

2. **Add Health Check Endpoint**

   - Implement a simple GET `/health` endpoint that returns a status message (e.g., `{ status: 'ok' }`).
   - This will be used to verify the server is running.

3. **Logging**

   - Add basic console logging for server startup and incoming requests.

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for port and environment (development/production).
   - Document required environment variables in a `.env.example` file.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The server starts without errors using `node backend/index.js`.
- The `/health` endpoint returns a 200 status and `{ status: 'ok' }`.
- The port can be configured via environment variable.
- Startup and request logs appear in the console.

### Notes

- This is the foundation for all further backend development.
- No middleware, error handling, or advanced features are included in this step.
- Next steps will build on this base (middleware, error handling, CORS, etc.).
