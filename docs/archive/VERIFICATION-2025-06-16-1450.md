# Express Server Implementation Verification

## Status Assessment (2025-06-16)

- [x] Feature/code exists in backend/index.js
- [x] Basic Express setup complete
- [x] Core middleware implemented
- [x] Health endpoint verified and working
- [x] Environment configuration complete with .env.example

### Verification Results

1. Server Configuration:

   - Express instance running successfully
   - Port configuration using environment variable: `process.env.PORT || 3000`
   - .env.example exists with proper configuration

2. Health Check Endpoint:

   - Endpoint: GET `/health`
   - Returns: `{"status":"ok"}` with 200 status
   - Verified working via curl test

3. Environment Configuration:
   - PORT configuration in place
   - NODE_ENV setting available
   - .env.example properly documented

## Existing Implementation Details

### Server Configuration

```javascript
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
```

✓ Basic Express instance created
✓ Port defined (needs env var support)

### Middleware Setup

1. CORS Configuration ✓

   ```javascript
   app.use(cors());
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
     // ...headers configuration
   });
   ```

2. Request Parsing ✓

   ```javascript
   app.use(express.json());
   ```

3. Logging Middleware ✓
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log(`Incoming request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
     next();
   });
   ```

## Requirements Status

All requirements have been verified as complete:

1. Health Check Endpoint ✓

   - GET `/health` implemented and working
   - Returns `{ status: 'ok' }` with 200 status
   - Verified via curl test

2. Environment Configuration ✓
   - PORT from environment variable implemented
   - .env.example exists with proper configuration
   - NODE_ENV configuration included

## Next Steps

1. ✓ All initial requirements met
2. Consider future enhancements:
   - Additional health check metrics
   - Enhanced logging configuration
   - Documentation updates

## Verification Status

- Core Server: ✓ COMPLETE - Express server running and properly configured
- Middleware: ✓ COMPLETE - CORS, JSON parsing, and logging middleware all functional
- Environment Config: ✓ COMPLETE - PORT and NODE_ENV in .env.example, environment variables properly used
- Health Check: ✓ COMPLETE - /health endpoint returns {"status":"ok"} with 200 status

All components verified and working as of 2025-06-16. No further action required.
