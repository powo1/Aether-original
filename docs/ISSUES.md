# Implementation Issues & Task Breakdown: React Frontend

## Purpose

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the implementation tasks for the React Frontend, as outlined in the Core Infrastructure section of the MVP Checklist and NEXT_STEPS.

## React Frontend Implementation

### Goal

Establish a functional React frontend that communicates with the backend and provides a foundation for UI/UX.

### Tasks & Subtasks

1. **Project Structure & Setup**

   - [ ] Ensure `/frontend` directory exists and is a valid React project (e.g., created with Create React App or Vite).
   - [ ] Organize folders for components, assets, and styles.
   - [ ] Add README or documentation for frontend setup.

2. **App Component & Routing**

   - [ ] Implement a basic `App.js` (or `App.jsx`) as the root component.
   - [ ] Set up routing if multiple pages are needed (e.g., React Router).

3. **State Management**

   - [ ] Use React's `useState` and `useEffect` for local state.
   - [ ] Plan for global state (e.g., Context API or Redux) if needed for future features.

4. **API Integration**

   - [ ] Implement a utility for making API calls (e.g., using `fetch` or `axios`).
   - [ ] Create functions to call backend endpoints (e.g., `/prompt`, `/preview`, `/health`).
   - [ ] Handle loading, success, and error states for API calls.

5. **Error Handling & Feedback**

   - [ ] Display user-friendly error messages for failed API calls.
   - [ ] Add loading indicators for async operations.
   - [ ] Log errors for debugging.

6. **Basic UI/UX**

   - [ ] Implement a minimal UI for user interaction (prompt input, preview, etc.).
   - [ ] Apply basic styling for usability and clarity.
   - [ ] Ensure accessibility best practices are followed.

7. **Testing & Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm the app starts with `npm start` in `/frontend`.
   - [ ] Verify backend communication works (e.g., prompt submission, preview display).
   - [ ] Test error handling and UI feedback.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- App starts and runs without errors.
- User can submit prompts and see results from the backend.
- Errors are handled gracefully and displayed to the user.
- Code is organized and documented for future development.

## Notice

**Database Setup** will be the next area of focus after React Frontend implementation and verification.
