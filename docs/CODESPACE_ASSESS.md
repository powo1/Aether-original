# Codespace Assessment and Migration Plan

## Proposed Change Analysis - 2025-06-15

### Current Issue

Warning message indicates multiple package manager conflict:

```
Using npm as the preferred package manager. Found multiple lockfiles for /workspaces/Aether-original.
To resolve this issue, delete the lockfiles that don't match your preferred package manager
or change the setting "npm.packageManager" to a value other than "auto".
```

### Devcontainer Configuration - Critical Component

#### Current Configuration

```json
"postCreateCommand": "npm install && npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install puppeteer"
```

#### Proposed Change

```json
"postCreateCommand": "npm install && npm install puppeteer"
```

### Change Impact Analysis

1. **Direct Effects**

   - Removes pnpm global installation
   - Changes puppeteer installation to use npm instead of pnpm
   - Simplifies package management to single tool (npm)

2. **Risk Assessment**

   - Puppeteer functionality might be affected
   - Need to verify npm installs all required puppeteer dependencies
   - May need to adjust puppeteer version in package.json

3. **Dependencies**

   - Verify puppeteer is correctly listed in package.json
   - Check for any pnpm-specific puppeteer configurations
   - Ensure all puppeteer dependencies are available via npm

4. **Verification Steps Needed**
   - Test puppeteer functionality after change
   - Verify no pnpm-related errors occur
   - Check application features that use puppeteer

### Implementation Plan

1. Document current state ✓
2. Backup devcontainer.json
3. Make single focused change
4. Test thoroughly
5. Revert if any issues

## Previous Analysis

### Package Manager Conflict

Warning Message:

```
Using npm as the preferred package manager. Found multiple lockfiles for /workspaces/Aether-original.
To resolve this issue, delete the lockfiles that don't match your preferred package manager
or change the setting "npm.packageManager" to a value other than "auto".
```

### File Dependencies Analysis

1. **Lockfiles Present:**

   - `/package-lock.json` (npm)
   - `/pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm)
   - `/frontend/package-lock.json` (npm)

2. **Configuration Files:**

   ```json
   // .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
   "postCreateCommand": "npm install && npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install puppeteer"
   ```

   ⚠️ Mixed package manager usage detected

3. **Node Modules Structure:**

   - Current: May contain `.pnpm/` subdirectories
   - Required: Clean npm-only structure

4. **Package.json Dependencies:**
   - Root: Using npm format
   - Frontend: Using npm format
   - Puppeteer: Installed via pnpm (needs migration)

### Impact Assessment

#### Critical Updates Required:

1. **devcontainer.json**:

   - Remove pnpm installation
   - Migrate puppeteer to npm
   - Update postCreateCommand

2. **Dependencies**:

   - Clean installation required
   - Update puppeteer installation method
   - Verify all dependency versions

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Remove pnpm-lock.yaml
   - Clean and rebuild node_modules
   - Update any pnpm-specific paths

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Cleanup

- [ ] Remove pnpm-lock.yaml
- [ ] Clean node_modules directories
- [ ] Remove any pnpm cache

### Phase 2: Configuration Updates

- [ ] Update devcontainer.json
- [ ] Verify package.json dependencies
- [ ] Update installation scripts

### Phase 3: Verification

- [ ] Clean install with npm
- [ ] Test application startup
- [ ] Verify no package manager conflicts

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Dependency Resolution:**

   - Risk: Version conflicts during migration
   - Mitigation: Maintain version lockfile backup

2. **Build Process:**

   - Risk: Build scripts dependency on pnpm
   - Mitigation: Verify all build steps work with npm

3. **Development Workflow:**
   - Risk: Developer scripts using pnpm
   - Mitigation: Update documentation and scripts

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve migration plan
2. Execute cleanup phase
3. Implement configuration updates
4. Run verification tests
